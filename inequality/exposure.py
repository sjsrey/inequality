    Classic Exposure Index

    Parameters
    ----------

    data          : a pandas DataFrame
    
    group_pop_var : string
                    The name of variable in data that contains the population size of the group of interest (X)
                    
    total_pop_var : string
                    The name of variable in data that contains the total population of the unit

    Attributes
    ----------

    statistic : float
                Exposure Index
        
    Examples
    --------
    In this example, we will calculate the Exposure Index (xPy) for the Riverside County using the census tract data of 2010.
    The group of interest (X) is non-hispanic black people which is the variable nhblk10 in the dataset and the Y group is the other part of the population.
    
    Firstly, we need to read the data:
    
    >>> url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renanxcortes/inequality-segregation-supplementary-files/master/data/std_2010_fullcount.csv'
    >>> census_2010 = pd.read_csv(url, encoding = "ISO-8859-1", sep = ",")
    
    Then, we filter only for the desired county (in this case, Riverside County):
    
    >>> df = census_2010.loc[census_2010.county == "Riverside County"][['pop10','nhblk10']]
    
    The value is estimated below.
    
    >>> exposure_index = exposure(df, 'nhblk10', 'pop10')
    >>> exposure_index.statistic
    0.886785172226587
    
    The interpretation of this number is that if you randomly pick a X member of a specific area, there is 88.68% of probability that this member shares a unit with a Y member.

    The group of interest is labelled as group X, whilst Y is the complementary group. Groups X and Y are mutually excludent.
